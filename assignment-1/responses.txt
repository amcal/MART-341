1. A directory is where folders. subfolders and files are stored, nesting inside each other so they can all be accessed from the root folder.

2. VCS can be used to look at old versions of a project (like an autosave does, only it's manual), so that if you have a mistake and don't know where you went wrong, you can look
back at old versions to see if you can find the problem. It is also helpful for sharing with others so they can see your progress.

3. I really enjoy working with video editors because there are so many options to work with: cropping, text, movement on the screen, and sound, to name just a few.
